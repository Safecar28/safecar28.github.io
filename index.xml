      <description>| The World of Virtual Connections | | Days have passed and the world has been moving towards virtual connections, proving that humanity can still educate, entertain and nourish themselves from afar. | When we had our first virtual class, I was very excited, using IT to study sounded awesome.
So, I joined my first meeting the day, it was our Vice Principal&amp;rsquo;s meeting and I had anticipated this to be great.</description>

      <description>Hello Folks This is the post where I describe the first day of lockdown. Lets get started. So, during the first few days of the start of the pandemic, I was still gathering information, everything seemed random and I did not acknowledge the cause yet.
So I started digging and found the origin, China. I am not actually blaming China for this but this where hell began. Wuhan has a wet market which sell fresh slaughters and one of the Pangolins in the market caught the pathogen through a bat.</description>
